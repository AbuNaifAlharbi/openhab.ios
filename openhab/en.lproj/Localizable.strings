This program is a client for openHAB system which can be found at http:\/\/openhab.org. For support on openHAB please visit openHAB home page.

The open Home Automation Bus (openHAB) project aims at providing a universal integration platform for all things around home automation.

It is designed to be absolutely vendor-neutral as well as hardware\/protocol-agnostic. openHAB brings together different bus systems, hardware devices and interface protocols by dedicated bindings. These bindings send and receive commands and status updates on the openHAB event bus. This concept allows designing user interfaces with a unique look&feel, but with the possibility to operate devices based on a big number of different technologies. Besides the user interfaces, it also brings the power of automation logics across different system boundaries.

At the time this text is written there are many different hardware/protocol bindings available in openHAB:

KNX
1-wire
Bluetooth
Wake-on-LAN
Network availability check
Commandline support
RS-232
HTTP
AVM Fritz!Box
Network Time Protocol (NTP)
MPD (Music Player Deamon)
